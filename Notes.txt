TODOS
-> refactor code 
-> write doc
-> function to write reports with valid informations about the survivors 
   (distance from the food and others)
-> Function to write data to be read after and continue the selection through days (save state) 

-> write problems faced and changes of plans
-> Create fitness score to select more people
-> change the way distance is calculated 
-> explore the magnitude of sizes that I'm using
-> prevent organisms to begin in the wall
-> why are there still organisms?
-> better way to get the output: I am just getting the bigger one


PROBLEMS
    The population is not growing, always one survive
    Dificulty to choose the initial range for weights and biases (|10| -> |1|)
    Dificulty to choose which inputs and outputs are better for the net
