MORE IMPORTANT
-> to deal with generations 
-> to analyze grade methods



-> write doc
-> show the id in the screen with orgs
-> write problems faced and changes of plans
-> change the way distance is calculated 
-> better way to get the output: I am just getting the bigger one


TRAIN 1
ordered by number of feeding 
2000 orgs 
select 100 bests
random foos spam
it seems to give the bests results


TRAIN 2
ordered by number of correct moves 
2000 orgs 
select 100 bests
random food spam
The results aren't good, by third gen, the number of feeding zero or one


TRAIN 3
the same as TRAIN 1, but with 20 gens

TRAIN 4
ordered by number of correct moves (by AP score)
2000 orgs 
select 100 bests
random food spam
vel = 10

TRAIN 5
same as before
vel = 1

TRAIN 6
same as before 
vel = 10
food and orgs can apear just on ten multiple positions
## Bests Results ##

TRAIN 7
same as train 6, but the bests orgs are also copied to the next gen 

TRAIN 8
Trying to understand why train 7 is not passing orgs to the next gen

Repeating train 6 to check if the good results were luck 

TRAIN 10
Repeating train 6, but with the 10 bests














TRAIN 7
the same as before, but with more time
